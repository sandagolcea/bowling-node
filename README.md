##Bowling Game Score Card in Node
This is a remake of the Game Score Card, made in node.

##To run
clone this project:  
`git clone git@github.com:sandagolcea/bowling-node.git`   
`cd bowling-node`  
`npm install`  
`npm test`  -- to test with jasmine  
`grunt` -- to test with Gruntfile.js  
This is a TDD approach and only runs basic tests atm.  

For a visual javascript version of the bowling scorecard, go to : https://github.com/sandagolcea/bowling
